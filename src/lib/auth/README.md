## Overview

The authentication system uses Supabase Authentication with a custom implementation layer that handles token management, session persistence, and protected routes. This implementation provides a secure, scalable authentication solution that can be shared across multiple applications built with this template.

## Directory Structure

The authentication system spans several directories:

```
src/
├── app/
│   └── (auth)/
│       ├── login/
│       ├── signup/
│       └── forgot-password/
├── lib/
│   └── auth/
│       └── AuthContext.tsx
└── types/
    └── auth/
        └── index.ts
```

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Context

The `AuthContext.tsx` provides global authentication state management with the following features:

- User session management
- Token refresh handling
- Role-based access control
- Error state management

### Authentication Flows

Each authentication flow follows a consistent pattern:

1. User Input Validation
2. API Request Handling
3. Error Management
4. Success State Handling
5. Session Storage

### Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security measures:

- CSRF protection through custom headers
- XSS prevention through proper content security policies
- Secure cookie handling for token storage
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Integration Guidelines

When extending or modifying authentication functionality:

1. Maintain proper type safety using the defined interfaces in `types/auth`
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add appropriate logging for security events
4. Update tests to cover new functionality

## Testing Requirements

Authentication features require thorough testing coverage:

1. Unit tests for individual authentication functions
2. Integration tests for complete authentication flows
3. Security testing for potential vulnerabilities
4. Performance testing for token refresh and session management

## Cross-Application Authentication

For applications that need to share authentication:

1. Use the TokenManager utility for secure token sharing
2. Implement proper session synchronization
3. Handle cross-origin authentication properly
4. Maintain consistent error handling across applications
