## Environment Setup

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up your development environment for this template. The setup process ensures consistency across all development environments while maintaining security and performance.

## Prerequisites

The development environment requires several key components:

Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher must be installed on your system. This ensures compatibility with all project dependencies and build tools.

A Supabase account and project must be created before beginning development. This provides the necessary backend infrastructure for your application.

Git must be installed for version control and collaboration capabilities.

## Initial Setup Process

The initial setup process consists of several key steps that must be completed in order.

### Repository Setup

Begin by cloning the repository to your local development environment:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```

### Environment Configuration

Create your local environment configuration by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the following required variables in your .env.local file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Dependency Installation

Install all required dependencies using the package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Tools Configuration

### Code Editor Setup

Your code editor should be configured with the following extensions:

TypeScript and JavaScript language features for proper code intelligence and type checking.

ESLint for code quality enforcement and consistency.

Prettier for code formatting according to project standards.

### Git Configuration

Configure your Git environment with appropriate user information and signing keys:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Database Configuration

### Supabase Setup

Access your Supabase project dashboard and configure the following:

Database schema according to your application requirements.

Authentication providers based on your needs.

Storage buckets if required by your application.

### Type Generation

Generate TypeScript types from your database schema:

```bash
npm run sync-types
```

## Running the Application

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing Environment

### Test Configuration

Configure your testing environment by setting up the necessary test databases and environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test.local
```

### Running Tests

Execute the test suite using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Production Environment

Configure your production environment variables in your hosting platform:

Set all required environment variables with production values.

Configure appropriate scaling parameters.

Set up monitoring and logging solutions.

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues during setup, verify the following:

Environment variables are properly configured in your .env.local file.

Node.js version meets the minimum requirements.

All dependencies are properly installed and up to date.

Database connection strings are correct and accessible.

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Additional Required Variables
# (Add other required variables based on actual implementation)
```

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── (auth)/
│   │   ├── login/
│   │   ├── signup/
│   │   └── forgot-password/
│   └── (dashboard)/
│       └── [workspace]/
├── components/
├── lib/
│   ├── auth/
│   └── supabase/
└── types/
```

## Testing Setup

### Prerequisites
- Test database configuration
- Test environment variables

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```
